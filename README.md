# VendingMachine
There was a vending machine next to my previous worksite. I like it because it is the place I can get refreshment, but I also hate it, as it is often empty for days without replenishment and I need to start all over if I want to buy another item. So here comes the idea of my own version of vending machine.
* Automatic replenishment notification system

  When the quantity of a specfic item reaches zero, it will automatically send an email to managers.
* multiple order

  select multiple items with different quantities. Don't have to select-pay-select-pay-again.

  ## Future improvement
  * More intelligent change function.
